## 🧠 Core Physics Modules

### 1. Schrödinger Equation Utilities
Solve for the energy levels and states of a particle in a 1D infinite potential well (particle in a box):
$$E_n = \frac{n^2 h^2}{8mL^2}$$

### 2. Heisenberg Uncertainty Engine
Rapidly determine the fundamental measurement limits for position ($x$) and momentum ($p$) to ensure calculations stay within theoretical bounds:
$$\Delta x \cdot \Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}$$

### 3. Wave Mechanics & Matter Waves
* **De Broglie Wavelength:** Quickly find the wavelength of matter waves for various kinetic energy levels.
* **Probability Density:** Analyze $\Psi$ (Psi) distributions across defined quantum states.
